# A mug of Radicchio

**A mug of Radicchio:** A personal website of a power looper and web devver.

**First of all:** Look at this one &ndash; [DNS Resolver Daemon (dnsresolvd)](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/rgolubtsov.github.io/tree/master/content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd "DNS Resolver Daemon") &ndash; a daemon that performs DNS lookups for the given hostname passed in an HTTP request. It might be interested or not along the site, ~~but it doesn't considered to have a separate repo.~~ but something got changed... and as of 2017-10-14 it has gained [its own repo](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/dnsresolvd-multilang "DNS Resolver Daemon") btw.

**Other stuff:** Semi-dummy site pages, CV, misc docs.
