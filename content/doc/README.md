# Assorted docs

### `docs -> content/doc`

Various documents collected here were written to show up the essence of how important to have certain instructions / guides in one place and at hand. Some of them may not be related closely to IT or CS somehow, but most of them did, and those are published first. Below are hyperlinks to these documents which are accessible on this site, and they are also located [on GitHub](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/rgolubtsov.github.io/tree/master/src/data/docs "Assorted docs on GitHub") for convenience.

Radicchio is using **[Window Maker](http://windowmaker.org "Window Maker: Window Manager for X")** as the only window manager on his desktops (Arch Linux / Arch Linux 32) and on OpenBSD VM-box when running of X Window System on the latter is required.

**Q:** Why to use **Window Maker** if there is a series of high quality sophisticated comprehensive desktop environments (DE) full of daily-handy features and visual attractiveness available for both Arch Linux and OpenBSD?

**A:** (a) It is quite attractive, (b) it resembles full-featured DEs in most cases like the `<Alt-Tab>` window switching experience, having window decorations with multiple functions on windows, with virtual desktops, and with globally accessible right-clicked contextual menus, (c) with little memory footprint, and (d) well-known to its apologist user how to configure it, tweak it, and relax with it. Despite its 1997th inception and having a set of approximately little functional changes which led to consider it an *ancient* window manager in some IT circles, **Window Maker** is continuously developed today and adopted by many Unix/Linux distros as [the interest-deserving project](https://repo.or.cz/wmaker-crm.git "The Window Maker window manager"). It is favorite and the only Radicchio's window manager in 2023 still.
