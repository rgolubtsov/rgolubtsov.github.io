# Assorted docs

### `docs -> content/doc`

Various documents collected here were written to show up the essence on how important to have certain instructions / guides in one place and at hand. Some of them are not related closely to IT or CS somehow, but most of them did, and those are published first. Below are hyperlinks to these documents which are accessible on this site, and they are also located [here](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/rgolubtsov.github.io/tree/master/src/data/docs "Assorted docs on GitHub") for convenience.
