# DNS Resolver Daemon (dnsresolvd)

**Performs DNS lookups for the given hostname passed in an HTTP request**

---

**TODO:** Describe what this daemon is for, and emphasize its necessity to be tailored as a multilingual project (*as you usually love to do that as I see it*).

---

The following implementations are on the bench (:small_blue_diamond: &ndash; complete, :small_orange_diamond: &ndash; planned/postponed, :cd: &ndash; in progress):

* :small_blue_diamond: **C ([GNU libmicrohttpd](https://gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd "GNU libmicrohttpd"))**: `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/c/`
* :small_blue_diamond: **JavaScript ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org "Node.js"))**: `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/js/`
* :small_orange_diamond: **Lua ([Luvit](https://luvit.io "Luvit"))**: `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/lua/`

---

**TODO:** Write doc sections like building, running, etc.
