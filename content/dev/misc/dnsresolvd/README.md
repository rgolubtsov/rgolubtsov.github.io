# DNS Resolver Daemon (dnsresolvd)

**Performs DNS lookups for the given hostname passed in an HTTP request**

---

**TODO:** Describe what this daemon is for, and emphasize its necessity to be tailored as a multilingual project (*as you usually love to do that as I see it*).

---

The following implementations are on the bench (:small_blue_diamond: &ndash; completed, :small_orange_diamond: &ndash; planned/postponed, :cd: &ndash; in progress):

:small_blue_diamond: **JavaScript (Node.js):** `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/js/`
:small_blue_diamond: **C (GNU libmicrohttpd):** `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/c/`
:small_orange_diamond: **Lua (Luvit):** `content/dev/misc/dnsresolvd/lua/`

---

**TODO:** Write doc sections like building, running, etc.
