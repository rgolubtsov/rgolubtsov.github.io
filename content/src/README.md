# Assorted sources

**`srcs -> content/src`**

A series of scripts located here, written in various programming languages, is meant at demonstrating techniques to directly port the code from one programming language to another. This is very beneficial when learning new programming languages based on those already learned and used previously or currently.

For the moment there are two independent algorithms were chosen and implemented as scripts:

1. To search for and return an equilibrium index of a given array of integers.
2. To make replacements in words of a given sentence and return an updated sentence.

Both algorithms are implemented in the same set of programming languages, sequentially. Or sometimes simultaneously.

**TBD.**
