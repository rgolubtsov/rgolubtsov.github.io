<div style="margin-bottom:10px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Personal role in the project:</span> There was a number of consequent tests performed against the Nginx web server for serving high loaded websites of the University. This was crucially important to realize that in peak intervals, where the amount of client requests was relatively big, Nginx showed great performance comparing with the former their web server &ndash; Apache HTTP Server. Thus, based on those tests a common decision was taken &ndash; to replace the Apache web server with Nginx, i.e. to completely migrate all the supplementary and subsidiary websites of the University to Nginx. Such a decision has been finally carried out with further sites' testing and supporting on a brand new web server.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:10px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Personal role in the project:</span> Selection of the front-end theme (template) for the new portal.

Namely, these are: October CMS, TYPO3, and Joomla. Installation, fine tuning, and configuring a one of these three CMSs, that is best fitted to the new web portal of the University, for its building and evolving, and for the further management of its parts and components during both development and normal production use. The main requirements are: (1) the CMS needs to provide extended permissions and user roles management functionality out of the box, (2) the existence of rich community and ecosystem having freely available plugins for various purposes, (3) to provide the possibility to perform yet simple content management-related tasks for users having too diversed technical skills. Finally, the CMS chosen was Joomla! and its accompanied RDBMS was MariaDB. Initial development of the new web portal of the University based on this CMS: selection of the front-end theme for the new portal, development of the navigational structure, creating a set of semi-dummy pages written in three languages (Russian, Byelorussian, English). Also two special pages in these three languages were completely designed, created, and populated ("About the University" and "Contacts").
