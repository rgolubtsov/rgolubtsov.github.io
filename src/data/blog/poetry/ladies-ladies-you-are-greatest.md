# Ladies, ladies, you are greatest!

### ...You are modest, you are bright!

Ladies, ladies,<br />
You are greatest,<br />
You are modest,<br />
You are bright!

<br />Ladies, ladies,<br />
You are prettiest,<br />
You are glorious,<br />
You are right!

<br />Just because we trust in beauty,<br />
We are open (to) you whenever,<br />
And because (of) His crafted duty,<br />
We believe in love forever!

<br />What was driven us decide,<br />
That you're glorious, why're you right?!<br />
&mdash; Wonderly! &mdash; We know the answer &mdash;<br />
It's because (of) your clever mind:<br />
We are head, but you are neck,<br />
You direct us! &mdash; We just make.

<br />And tonight, tomorrow... after,<br />
You'll be blessed (by) your own Crafter,<br />
We will want you'll blossom springs,<br />
Showed your fingers shined in rings! :ring:
