### Zabbix 6.0.7 to 6.0.8 upgrade gotchas regarding slow MariaDB SQL requests

*16th of November, 2022*

Once having the Zabbix 6.0.8 LTS release running after upgrading from the 6.0.7 LTS release, a one unexpected thing might occur during the monitoring process in a series of screens in Zabbix web interface. And this weird thing will appear repeatedly, again and again on some monitoring screens for a long time. What is this actually? &ndash; Well, this is very slow scanning and updating, for example, the list of hosts, host groups, and triggers... that's saying unacceptably slow scanning.

**TBD**
