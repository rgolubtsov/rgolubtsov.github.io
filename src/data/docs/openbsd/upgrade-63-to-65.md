# Upgrade OpenBSD 6.3 to 6.5

### OpenBSD/amd64 6.3 to 6.5 Upgrade Instructions

As clearly stated in the OpenBSD FAQ regarding upgrading one release to another, *upgrades are only supported from one release to the release immediately following it*. So what to do if it needs to upgrade the 6.3 release of OpenBSD to the 6.5 release is to upgrade sequentially, first to the 6.4 release, and then to the 6.5 release.

**Upgrade OpenBSD 6.3 release to 6.4 release**
